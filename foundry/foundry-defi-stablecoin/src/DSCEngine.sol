 * @title DSCEngine
 * @author Md. Mahadi Hassan Riyadh
 *
 *
 * This system is designed to be as minimal as possible, and haev the token maintain a 1 token =  $1 peg.
 * This stablecoin has the properties:
 * - Dollar Pegged
 * - Algorithmically Stable
 * - Exogenous Collateral
 *
 * It is similar to DAI if DAI had no governance, no fees, and was only backed by wBTC and wETH.
 *
 * Our DSC system should always be "overcollateralized". At no point, should the value of all collateral <= the $ backed value of all DSC.
 *
 * @notice This contract is the core of the DSC System. It handles all the logic for mining and redeeming DSC, as well as depositing & withdrawing collateral.
 * @notice This contract is VERY loosely based on the MakerDAO DSS (DAI) system, but is much simpler and has no governance or fees.

        For exaple, I have:
        - $100 worth of ETH collateral
        - $50 worth of DSC

        But suddenly, the price of ETH drops by 60%.
        Now, I have:
        - $40 worth of ETH collateral
        - $50 worth of DSC

        I am undercollateralized by $10.
        I need to liquidate some DSC to get back to a safe position.
        Or the system should have a checking mechanism to liquidate my DSC, if I am undercollateralized, to save the system.
        Even in some scenarios, I can get kicked out of the system.

        This liquidate() function is a function which other users can call to remove people from the system who are undercollateralized to save the protocol.
    */
    function liquidate() external {}

    /*  
        There should be a health factor to know the health of the system or protocol.

        Again back to our previous example:
        I had:
        - $100 worth of ETH collateral
        - $50 worth of DSC

        We set a threshold of 150% maximum collateralization ratio.
        Now I have, let's say:
        - $74 worth of ETH collateral
        - $50 worth of DSC
        I am UNDERCOLLATERALIZED!!!!!!!!!

        Now, someone can call the liquidate() function to liquidate my DSC to save the system.
        - Someone will say, I'll pay back the $50 DSC and get all your Collateral (ETH).
        - So that someone is getting $74 worth of ETH by paying $50 DSC.
        - He/she is getting $24 profit.
        - And I am out of the system.
        - This is my punishment for being undercollateralized.
