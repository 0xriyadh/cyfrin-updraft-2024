 * This system is designed to be as minimal as possible, and haev the token maintain a 1 token =  $1 peg.
 * This stablecoin has the properties:
 * - Dollar Pegged
 * - Algorithmically Stable
 * - Exogenous Collateral
 * 
 * It is similar to DAI if DAI had no governance, no fees, and was only backed by wBTC and wETH.
 * 
 * @notice This contract is the core of the DSC System. It handles all the logic for mining and redeeming DSC, as well as depositing & withdrawing collateral.
 * @notice This contract is VERY loosely based on the MakerDAO DSS (DAI) system, but is much simpler and has no governance or fees.
