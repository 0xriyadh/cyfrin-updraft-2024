# Foundry Defi Stablecoin Project
1. Relative Stability: Our stablecoin is anchored or pegged to the US dollar -> $1.00
    - Chainlink Price Feed
    - Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC to their dollar equivalent
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
    - People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral (coded)
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
    - wETH (wrapped ETH)
    - wBTC (wrapped BTC)
